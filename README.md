# Streamly

A simple free movie streaming web application created with Nextjs, using the TMDB Api's.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Why?
I was facing an issue in streaming movies, so i created a web app for me and some people, who can enjoy streaming without other sites getting down and banned.

## How?
1.  Used the TMDB API's for movie related details and searches.
2.  Used the super embed stream for movie player, with subs, quality control etc.


## How to run

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
